# Nim false positive reduction suite

A suite of Nim programs and datasets that I use to create emails which I then send to antivirus companies in order to get them to stop flagging Nim as malware.

*note:* This code is not up to my standards as I made it only for myself as a quick hackjob, be warned, the code blinds its readers.

## How to use

1. Get a VirusTotal API key and make a file named `vt_key` containing it.
